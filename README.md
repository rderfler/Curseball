This was an effort to create a cursed expirience for `blaseball.com` as a submission for `https://cursed.sibr.dev/`
The intent was to create a web extension that would apply to `blaseball.com` though I ran into some complications.

A video deminstrating the functionality can be found `SnackathonCurseball.mp4`

I made this heavily relying on Rust and web assembly because I think they are cool and wanted to have some more experience working with them.
